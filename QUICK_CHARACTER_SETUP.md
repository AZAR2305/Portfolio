# 🎯 Quick Setup: Add Your 3D Character

## ✅ Current Status
- **Development server**: Running at `http://localhost:5174/`
- **Character system**: Ready and working with Ready Player Me fallback
- **Custom character**: Disabled (to prevent errors)

## 🚀 To Add Your Own Character (3 Easy Steps):

### Step 1: Get a 3D Character Model
**Easiest Option - Ready Player Me:**
1. Visit: https://readyplayer.me/
2. Create your avatar (takes 2-3 minutes)
3. Download as GLB format

**Other Options:**
- Use any GLB/GLTF model you have
- Download from Sketchfab, Mixamo, etc.

### Step 2: Add Model to Project
Place your model file here:
```
public/models/my-character.glb
```
(Replace "my-character.glb" with your actual filename)

### Step 3: Enable Your Character
In `src/App.jsx`, around line 91, change:
```jsx
// FROM:
useCustomCharacter={false}
customCharacterUrl="/models/your-character.glb"

// TO:
useCustomCharacter={true}
customCharacterUrl="/models/my-character.glb"  // Use your actual filename
```

## 🎮 Features Your Character Will Have:
- ✅ **Mouse tracking**: Head follows cursor
- ✅ **Animations**: Auto-detects idle, walk, wave, etc.
- ✅ **Positioning**: Appears in hero section
- ✅ **Interactions**: Smooth movements and transitions
- ✅ **Fallback**: Shows placeholder if model fails

## 🛠️ Customization Options:
```jsx
<CustomCharacter
  modelUrl="/models/my-character.glb"
  scale={1.8}                    // Size (1.0 = normal, 2.0 = double)
  position={[3, -1, 0]}          // [left/right, up/down, forward/back]
  currentAnimation="idle"         // idle, walk, wave, sit, talk
  enableMouseTracking={true}      // Head follows mouse
  headTrackingStrength={0.3}      // How much (0-1)
/>
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting:
- **Model won't load**: Check file path and make sure it's in `public/models/`
- **Animations not working**: That's OK! The character will still appear
- **Character too big/small**: Adjust the `scale` value
- **Wrong position**: Adjust the `position` array

## 📁 File Structure:
```
public/
  models/
    my-character.glb     ← Your character goes here
src/
  components/3d/
    CustomCharacter.jsx  ← The component that loads your model
    MasterCanvas.jsx     ← Main 3D scene
```
